# AI Assistance Log (PROMPTS.md)

This file documents how I used AI (ChatGPT) to help me complete the project.  
All code and analysis were understood and typed by me; the AI acted as a tutor.

---

## Session 1 — 2025-08-25
**Goal:** Get repository set up; make `analysis.py` scaffold; fix environment issues.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “Help me make a small Iris analysis script that saves a CSV if missing, writes a summary, and plots histograms.”  
- “Why does `python3 analysis.py` say the file isn’t found?”  
**Outcome:**  
- Created `analysis.py` with functions: `get_data()`, `write_summary()`, `save_histograms()`.  
- Added `data/` and `images/` folders.  
- Committed incremental changes to GitHub.

---

## Session 2 — 2025-08-25
**Goal:** Add a Jupyter notebook for exploratory run.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “Make a minimal notebook that loads `data/iris.csv`, shows shape & class counts, and plots histograms.”  
**Outcome:**  
- Added `iris_analysis.ipynb` and ran cells.  
- Confirmed images save into `images/`.

---

## Session 3 — 2025-08-25
**Goal:** Polish documentation and reproducibility.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “Write a clean `README.md` with what the project contains and how to run it.”  
- “What should go in `requirements.txt`?”  
- “How do I ignore `.ipynb_checkpoints` and Anaconda artifacts?”  
**Outcome:**  
- Wrote `README.md` with run instructions, outputs, and references.  
- Added `requirements.txt` with pinned minimum versions.  
- Updated `.gitignore` to ignore local artifacts.

---

## Session 4 — 2025-08-25
**Goal:** Verify pipeline works end-to-end.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “How to create a simple pipeline that loads Iris, generates `summary.txt`, and saves histograms automatically?”  
**Outcome:**  
- Pipeline confirmed working: loads Iris from `data/iris.csv`, regenerates CSV if missing, writes `summary.txt`, and saves plots into `images/`.

---

## Session 5 — 2025-08-25
**Goal:** Debug issues with pandas and regenerate clean CSV.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “Why does pandas show ‘file not found’ or invalid header errors?”  
**Outcome:**  
- Fixed header assignment for Iris dataset.  
- Confirmed correct DataFrame with class counts.  
- Pipeline runs without errors.

---

## Session 6 — 2025-08-25
**Goal:** Final polish and reproducibility.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “Write a clean `README.md` with what the project contains and how to run it.”  
- “What goes into `requirements.txt` for this project?”  
**Outcome:**  
- `README.md` updated with run steps and references.  
- `requirements.txt` added with pinned minimum versions.

---

## Session 7 — 2025-08-26
**Goal:** Transparency about AI usage.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “How should I disclose AI help for this assignment?”  
**Outcome:**  
- Added short disclosure to `README.md`.  
- Full log recorded here in `PROMPTS.md`.

---

## Notes
- Any files/folders created automatically by tools (e.g., `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, `anaconda_projects/`, `*.db`) are ignored via `.gitignore`.  
- All plots and CSVs were generated by running the code in this repository.

## Why AI was used
I used ChatGPT as a tutor to:
- Clarify instructions when I was stuck.  
- Learn how to structure commits and GitHub Issues properly.  
- Debug error messages in Python and Git.  
- Polish documentation (`README.md` and `PROMPTS.md`).
