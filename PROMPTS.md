# AI Assistance Log (PROMPTS.md)

This document explains how I used an AI assistant (ChatGPT) while completing this project.
All coding decisions were understood by me and typed by me; the AI acted as a tutor/coach.
Prompts are *summarised*, not verbatim.

## How I used AI (summary)

- Step-by-step guidance for Git/GitHub workflow (clone, add, commit, push).
- Debugging error messages from Python/pandas and improving the script.
- Designing a small pipeline that:
  - creates `data/iris.csv` (from scikit-learn) if missing,
  - writes a quick `summary.txt`,
  - saves histograms and scatter plots to `images/`.
- Creating a minimal Jupyter Notebook for quick exploration.
- Polishing `README.md` (run instructions, references) and creating `requirements.txt`.

## Sessions

### Session 1 — 2025-08-25
**Goal:** Get the repository set up locally, open it in VS Code, and confirm Python runs.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “Show me the exact git commands to clone, add, commit, push.”
- “How do I run a Python file from the terminal in this folder?”
**Outcome:** Repo cloned, terminal working in the project folder, simple sanity script created and executed.

---

### Session 2 — 2025-08-25
**Goal:** Create `analysis.py` scaffold and verify libraries import.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “Make a minimal script that imports pandas/matplotlib and prints a confirmation.”
**Outcome:** `analysis.py` scaffold created; imports verified; committed to GitHub.

---

### Session 3 — 2025-08-25
**Goal:** Build the Iris pipeline (CSV + summary + plots).  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “Write functions to load Iris from scikit-learn, save `data/iris.csv`, write `summary.txt`, and save histograms and scatter plots into `images/`.”
- “Add a `main()` that runs everything.”
**Outcome:** Code added; running `python3 analysis.py` generated:
- `data/iris.csv`
- `summary.txt`
- images in `images/` (histograms and scatter plots)  
All files committed and pushed.

---

### Session 4 — 2025-08-25
**Goal:** Fix CSV parsing issues and regenerate clean data.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “Explain the pandas ParserError and how to regenerate a clean CSV.”
**Outcome:** Script now regenerates `data/iris.csv` from scikit-learn if the file is missing or invalid; rerun succeeded.

---

### Session 5 — 2025-08-25
**Goal:** Create a Jupyter notebook for quick, visual exploration.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “Create `iris_analysis.ipynb` that loads `data/iris.csv`, shows `head()`, class counts, and a couple of plots.”
**Outcome:** Notebook created and saved in repo root; confirmed it runs locally; committed to GitHub.

---

### Session 6 — 2025-08-25
**Goal:** Polish documentation & reproducibility.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “Write a clean `README.md` with what the project contains and how to run it.”
- “What goes into `requirements.txt` for this project?”
**Outcome:** `README.md` updated with run steps and references; `requirements.txt` added with pinned minimum versions.

---

### Session 7 — 2025-08-26
**Goal:** Transparency about AI usage.  
**Main prompts (summary):**
- “How should I disclose AI help for this assignment?”
**Outcome:** Short disclosure added to `README.md`; full log recorded in `PROMPTS.md` (this file).

## Notes
- Any files/folders created automatically by tools (e.g., `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, `anaconda_projects/`, `*.db`) are ignored via `.gitignore`.
- All plots and CSVs were generated by running the code in this repository.
